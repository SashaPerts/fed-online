    <h1>
        Lorem ipsum
    </h1>
    <p>
        In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

    <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h2>   <!-- Example text -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Minus delectus quas corporis at! Explicabo, est quibusdam. Accusantium aliquid neque alias. Consectetur sint pariatur, recusandae, quod reiciendis veniam ipsa in nulla voluptatum commodi iste itaque eveniet vero beatae. Praesentium cumque consectetur quis debitis? Architecto neque libero sint nisi sed pariatur, aperiam perferendis veniam aut dolor tempore ipsum assumenda, animi illum omnis.</p>
    <h3>Source text</h3>
    <p>The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum. The physical source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and continues on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the galley type of that page was mixed up to make the dummy text seen today.</p>

    <h4>Discovery of the text's origin</h4>
    <p>The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampden-Sydney College. McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime before 1982 while searching for instances of the Latin word consectetur, which was rarely used in classical literature. McClintock first published his discovery in a 1994 letter to the editor of Before & After magazine, contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem ipsum held no meaning.</p>

    <h5>HTML</h5>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <h6>CSS</h6>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
